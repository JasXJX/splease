# Splease: an app for splitting your bills 

(work in progress!)

## Intro

Eating out with friends is a fun experience; but when the bill comes, a question arises: how do you pay? The younger generation tend to want to split the bill instead of taking turns picking it up, but when Jack ordered the expensive steak, Jason got 2 drinks, and Joy got an appetizer only, how do you divide the bill so that each person is only paying for their own portion? 

This problem, while very first-world and not considered by many people, is one that I am bothered by way too often - which is why I've decided to create a project to solve it.

My goal is to create a utility tool for computing the fair share of each receipt. The user would need to input the items, their prices, who ordered the item, and taxes and tips percentage (or whole amount); the tool would then calculate each person's proportion accordingly. 

## Current progress

Building a draft front end process.
